            <p>Hm, to get to know me, maybe you need to know my ultimate goal?</p>

            <p>My ultimate goal is to become a teacher, or to create work that inspires and supports the next generation
                of learners. To reach that goal, I’m committed to expanding my knowledge and honing my skills. </p>
            <p>I’m
                actively engaged in learning and applying what I know through projects, I love collaborating with
                friends
                to bring our ideas to life.</p>

            <p>I’m aware that teaching requires experience and expertise, so I strive to build a strong foundation now.
                After completing my studies at polytechnic, I hope to continue learning and growing at university,
                preparing myself to make a positive impact in education!</p>
